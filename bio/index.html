            Caleb has loved building things since age two when his parents gave him his first Lego set. He has loved computers since his father paid him to learn to touch type on the family’s Apple//e at the age of six. He has loved programming, especially graphics programming, since age 15 when he accidentally enrolled in a high school computer science course.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Most importantly, Caleb has loved people and building tools which make their lives better since becoming a Christian at age 18. The command to “love your neighbor as yourself” is still applicable amidst the high technology of the 21st century.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Caleb's love for both people and software has lead him to focus on user interfaces for the majority of his career. His desire to purposefully deliver the best experience possible has lead him to increasingly focus on the adjacent field of user experience.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            While in University, Caleb worked as an embedded systems developer, spent a semester studying in the Computer Science department's virtual reality lab, and a Summer writing real-time signal processing software as part of the Electrical Engineering department's undergraduate Intern program.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Caleb spent his last year of school consulting for a precision agriculture company and was a Summer intern in BNSF Railway’s technology department. He has since worked at BNSF Railway for a little more than a decade.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Caleb is one of less than 10,000 of Human Factors International Certified Usability Analysts and is as comfortable interviewing and observing users as he is designing and developing user interfaces.
